# Data Analysis Pokemon Datasets


## Overview
This repository contains the final assignment portfolio project created for the Digital Skill Fair 24.0 hosted by Dibimbing.id. The project focuses on data analysis in the context of a Data Science role, using Pokemon datasets. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights, trends, and patterns within the Pokemon data, providing valuable information for enthusiasts and researchers alike.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Data:** Contains the datasets used for the analysis.
   - `Pokemon.csv`: Main dataset with Pokemon information.

2. **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks used for the data analysis.
   - `EDA-Pokemon Datasets.ipynb`: code collaboratory 

3. **Reports:** Summarized reports and findings.
   - `Data Science-Dibimbing.id.pdf`: Comprehensive report detailing the analysis and its results.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fanani-03/DataScience-Dibimbing.id-DSF24.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd DataScience-Dibimbing.id-DSF24
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` folder in sequential order.

4. Refer to the `Reports` folder for a detailed report on the data analysis.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn 
```
