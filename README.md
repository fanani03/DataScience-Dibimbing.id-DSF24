![Pokemon Data Analysis](link_to_image)

## Overview
This repository contains the final assignment portfolio project created for the Digital Skill Fair 24.0 hosted by Dibimbing.id. The project focuses on data analysis in the context of a Data Science role, using Pokemon datasets. Through this analysis, we aim to gain insights, trends, and patterns within the Pokemon data, providing valuable information for enthusiasts and researchers alike.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

1. **Data:** Contains the datasets used for the analysis.
   - `pokemon_data.csv`: Main dataset with Pokemon information.

2. **Notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks used for the data analysis.
   - `1_data_cleaning.ipynb`: Data cleaning and preprocessing.
   - `2_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
   - `3_statistical_analysis.ipynb`: Statistical analysis of the Pokemon data.

3. **Visualizations:** Visual representations generated during the analysis.
   - `bar_chart.png`: Example bar chart.
   - `scatter_plot.png`: Example scatter plot.

4. **Reports:** Summarized reports and findings.
   - `data_analysis_report.pdf`: Comprehensive report detailing the analysis and its results.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Data-Analysis-Pokemon-Datasets.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Data-Analysis-Pokemon-Datasets
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `Notebooks` folder in sequential order.

4. Explore the findings and visualizations in the `Visualizations` folder.

5. Refer to the `Reports` folder for a detailed report on the data analysis.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
```
